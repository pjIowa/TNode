# Why
> This started off as an experiment in using D3 to display tweets collected from a Python script.
> I wanted a way to see Twitter trends on a US map, nothing really tickled me.
> Over time, I added features requiring a true server, settling on NodeJS.  I made it a web framework
> so that people can interact with their data easier. Continue if you like.
